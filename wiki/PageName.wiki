#summary Project 4: MATLAB

= Introduction =

Jason Tsay and William Ting's implementation of a subset of MATLAB's matrix operations.

== Testing ==

Testing was primarily done through the console and CppUnit.

To test in the console, helper functions were made in order to neatly print matrices and vectors. 

Our CppUnit test cases tests each function implemented separately. In many cases, there are multiple tests per function, usually to test the function using a square matrix and a rectangular matrix. 

== Error Checking ==

Our input error checking is fairly minimal as no explicit error checking was specified. In operations that require compatible matrix sizes, we simply use assertions.

== Notes == 

=== slice_col and slice_row ===
Per MATLAB, we have shifted the index over by one.
Ex: slice_col(m, 1) returns the first column in the matrix, not the second
